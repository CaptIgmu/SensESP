# Get In Touch

By far the best way to get in touch with someone who can help you with a SensESP issue is through the #sensors channel on the Signalk-dev Slack. If you're not already a member there (it's free), [start here](http://slack-invite.signalk.org/).

Please do NOT create an Issue on the SensESP GitHub repo unless you have already posted about it on the #sensors channel on Slack. You might think it's a bug, but you're just doing something wrong. You might want to request an enhancement, but it may already do what you want. Ask first, then create an Issue only if it's still appropriate.
